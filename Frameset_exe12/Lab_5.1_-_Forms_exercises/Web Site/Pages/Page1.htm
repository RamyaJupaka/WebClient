			<dd><p>Coffee production in Colombia has a reputation as producing mild, well balanced coffee beans.
			Colombia's average annual coffee production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world, 
			after Brazil and Vietnam; though highest in terms of the arabica bean.The beans are exported to United States, 
			Germany, France, Japan, and Italy.Most coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region. 
			In 2007, the European Union granted Colombian coffee a protected designation of origin status.
			In 2011 UNESCO declared the coffee growing region a World Heritage site.</p>

			(However, it is not the only coffee grown on U.S. soil; 
			for example, Puerto Rico has had a coffee industry for some time, although it is not a state but a U.S. territory.
			Ramiro L. Colon worked in the coffee industry of Puerto Rico since 1925, for example. There are two experimental coffee 
			growing projects taking place in the United States in Santa Barbara, CA and in Georgia.)</p>

			<dd><p>Coffee production in Brazil is responsible for about a third of all coffee, making Brazil by far the world's 
			largest producer, a position the country has held for the last 150 years. Coffee plantations, covering some 27,000 km2 
			(10,000 sq mi), are mainly located in the southeastern states of Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo and Parana where the environment 
			and climate provide ideal growing conditions.</p><p>The crop first arrived in Brazil in the 18th century and the country 
			had become the dominant producer by the 1840s. Production as a share of world production peaked in the 1920s, 
			with the country supplying 80% of the world's coffee, but has declined since the 1950s due to increased global production.</p>

			<dd><p>Black tea is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, green and white teas. 
			Black tea is generally stronger in flavor than the less oxidized teas. All four types are made from leaves of the shrub 
			(or small tree) Camellia sinensis. Two principal varieties of the species are used â€“ the small-leaved Chinese variety plant 
			(C. sinensis subsp. sinensis), used for most other types of teas, and the large-leaved Assamese plant (C. sinensis subsp. assamica), 
			which was traditionally mainly used for black tea, although in recent years some green and white have been produced.</p>

			<dd><p>Green tea is made from Camellia sinensis leaves that have undergone minimal oxidation during processing.Green tea originated 
			in China, but its production has spread to many countries in Asia.</p><p>Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ 
			substantially due to growing conditions, horticulture, production processing, and time of harvest.</p>

		<dt id="white"><u>White tea</u></dt>
			<dd><p>Currently there is no general accepted definition of white tea and very little international agreement. 
			One source says that white tea is minimal processed tea (just drying, no fermentation or other procedures).
			Another says that "white tea is made from buds and young leaves, which are steamed or fired to inactivate polyphenol oxidase,
			and then dried."</p><p>It is harvested primarily in China, mostly in the Fujian province,but more recently it is grown in Eastern Nepal,
			Taiwan, Northern Thailand, Galle (Southern Sri Lanka) and India White tea comes from the buds and leaves of the Camellia 
			sinensis plant. The leaves and buds are allowed to wither and dry in natural sun.</p><p>The name "white tea" derives 
			from the fine silvery-white hairs on the unopened buds of the tea plant, which gives the plant a whitish appearance.
			The beverage itself is not white or colourless but pale yellow, light to the taste, and is free shaped.</p>
