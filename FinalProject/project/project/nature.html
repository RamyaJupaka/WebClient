	<p >Biological diversity, or biodiversity, is the scientific term for the variety of life on Earth. It refers not just to species but also to ecosystems and differences in genes within a single species. Everywhere on the planet, species live together and depend on one another. <br>Every living thing, including man, is involved in these complex networks of interdependent relationships, which are called ecosystems.

Healthy ecosystems clean our water, purify our air, maintain our soil, regulate the climate, recycle nutrients and provide us with food. They provide raw materials and resources for medicines and other purposes. They are at the foundation of all civilisation and sustain our economies.<br> It's that simple: we could not live without these “ecosystem services”. They are what we call our natural capital.

	Environmental protection is the practice of protecting the natural environment by individuals, organizations and governments.<br> Its objectives are to conserve natural resources and the existing natural environment and, where possible, to repair damage and reverse trends.

Due to the pressures of overconsumption, population growth and technology, the biophysical environment is being degraded, sometimes permanently. This has been recognized, and governments have begun placing restraints on activities that cause environmental degradation. Since the 1960s, environmental movements have created more awareness of the various environmental problems.<br> There is disagreement on the extent of the environmental impact of human activity and even scientific dishonesty occurs, so protection measures are occasionally debated.

	Nature is constantly changing, even before the dawn of humanity. <br>From the breakup of Pangaea to the extinction of dinosaurs, from the Sahara Pump to the Ice Age, Earth has completely changed from what it was millions of years ago. Beyond these spontaneous events, initiated by Nature itself, Humans are continuously adapting the Planet to accommodate their needs through careless interaction with their surrounding environment.The influence of anthropogenic factors is now intruded into every aspect of the environment. Emissions of chemical compounds into the air have greatly altered and modified the composition and energy balance of the atmosphere, thereby accelerating the pace of climate change.<br>Additionally, the expansion of human activities into the natural landscapes, mostly manifested by urbanization and agriculture developments, has led to the reduction and fragmentation of wildlife habitats and loss of valuable Fauna and Flora.<br> Furthermore, the discharge of industrial and agricultural runoff has contaminated rivers and streams, which severely disrupts the natural food-chain in the aquatic ecosystem and reduces the amount of freshwater, something that is indispensable for the survival of the species. It seems that human beings, who are always regarding themselves as the dominant species because of their cleverness and inventiveness, are pushing the earth into a danger zone.<a href="#top">Go to Top</a>

<p><a name="forest"><b>Forest</b></a>
Forests are our land’s trees and plants that cover a third of the earth’s surface symbolized by the color green in the common definition of environmentalism. <br>There are many reasons why forests are an important feature for the environment and in our daily lives.They are fundamental life forms and provide for the continuity of the world’s biodiversity which is necessary for economic development, diversity of life forms, human livelihood, and environmental adaptive responses.
Forests are mainly important because they stabilize climate, regulate the water cycle, and provides habitat to thousands of life forms. Below are the leading reasons signifying the importance of forest.

<p><a name="wildlife"><b>Wildlife</b></a>
Wildlife conservation is the practice of protecting wild species and their habitats in order to prevent species from going extinct. Major threats to wildlife include habitat destruction/degradation/fragmentation, overexploitation, poaching, hunting, pollution and climate change. The IUCN estimates that 27,000 species of the ones assessed are at risk for extinction. Expanding to all existing species, a 2019 UN report on biodiversity put this estimate even higher at a million species.<br> It's also being acknowledged that an increasing number of ecosystems on Earth containing endangered species are disappearing. To address these issues, there have been both national and international governmental efforts to preserve Earth's wildlife. Prominent conservation agreements include the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).<br>There are also numerous nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) dedicated to conservation such as the Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, and Conservation International.

<p><a name="precaution"><b>Precautions</b></a>
There are more than 7 billion people on Earth. Imagine if every one of us committed to do one thing — no matter how small — to protect wildlife every day. Even minor actions can have a major impact when we all work together. Here are ways you can make a difference:

1. Adopt. From wild animals to wild places, there’s an option for everyone. Get together with classmates to adopt an animal from a wildlife conservation organization such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Symbolic adoptions help fund organizations.<br><br>

2. Volunteer. If you don’t have money to give, donate your time. Many organizations and zoos have volunteer programs. You can help clean beaches, rescue wild animals or teach visitors.<br><br>

3. Visit. Zoos, aquariums, national parks and wildlife refuges are all home to wild animals. Learn more about our planet’s species from experts. See Earth’s most amazing creatures up close.<br><br>
4. Donate. When you visit your local accredited zoos and nature reserves, pay the recommended entry fee. Your donations help maintain these vital conservation areas.<br><br>

5. Speak Up. Share your passion for wildlife conservation with your family. Tell your friends how they can help. Ask everyone you know to pledge to do what they can to stop wildlife trafficking.<br><br>

6. Buy Responsibly. By not purchasing products made from endangered animals or their parts, you can stop wildlife trafficking from being a profitable enterprise.<br><br>

7. Pitch In. Trash isn’t just ugly, it’s harmful. Birds and other animals can trap their heads in plastic rings. Fish can get stuck in nets. Plus, trash pollutes everyone’s natural resources. Do your part by putting trash in its place.<br><br>
8. Recycle. Find new ways to use things you already own. If you can’t reuse, recycle. The Minnesota Zoo encourages patrons to recycle mobile phones to reduce demand for the mineral coltan, which is mined from lowland gorillas’ habitats.<br><br>

9. Restore. Habitat destruction is the main threat to 85 percent of all threatened and endangered species, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. You can help reduce this threat by planting native trees, restoring wetlands or cleaning up beaches in your area.<br><br>

10. Join. Whether you’re into protecting natural habitats or preventing wildlife trafficking, find the organization that speaks to your passion and get involved. Become a member. Stay informed. Actively support the organization of your choice<br><br>
